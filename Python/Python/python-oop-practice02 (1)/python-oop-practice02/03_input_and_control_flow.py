# ##You have learnt
# 1. Class & Object Basics
# Defined a custom Movie class using __init__
# Created multiple instances (objects) from a list of data
# Stored them in a list and accessed attributes via methods
# class Movie:
#     def __init__(self, name, genre, year):
#         ...
# 2. Encapsulation
# Used methods like display_info() to control how internal data is exposed
# Kept object data (self.name, self.genre, etc.) safe within the object
# 3. Dynamic Object Creation
# Converted raw movie data (dicts) into Movie objects using unpacking:
# movieStore = [Movie(**movie) for movie in movies]
# 4. Utility Functions (Outside Class)
# Created reusable logic like get_movies_by_year() outside the class
# Practiced separation of concerns: data vs. logic
# def get_movies_by_year(movie_list, year):
#     ...
# 5. User Input & Control Flow
# Took input from the terminal (input())
# Added basic CLI menu logic (if-elif-else)
# Used try-except for error handling (e.g., invalid year input)
# 6. Data Unpacking with **kwargs
# Learned the difference between *args (for tuples) and **kwargs (for dicts)
# Practiced adapting class constructors to match external data structure
